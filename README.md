# Wilson!

A 2-day group project developed over the weekend.
A turn based multiplayer survival game where cooperation is key in order to survive and escape a deserted island.

## The Development

This game was based on a client/server architecture featuring a lobby and a game stage. The game logic core was structured using the strategy design pattern in order to access and execute player actions. This provided scalability of a whole higher order of magnitude.
This project was brought to be with the combined use of Kanban methodology and short sprints during its development.

## My Role

My role was to work on the server side, trying to get all the users to get the information at the same time, and waiting for others to finish their turns and at the end of each turn, present the global game status to all users.

## Tech && Methodologies used

Java, IntelliJ, Linux, Mac OS, Google Slides, Prompt-View Library, Maven, Git, Kanban.
